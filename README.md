# SheetsFluttertest

A **Flutter chat room app** that uses **Google Sheets as a backend**.

Instead of a traditional database, this project stores messages in a Google Sheet — letting you read and write chat messages in real time from a spreadsheet.

## Features

- Real-time chat using Google Sheets as storage  
- Flutter UI with scrollable chat view  
- Add, read, and display messages dynamically  
- Lightweight solution for experimenting with backend-free chat  

## How It Works

- Messages are stored in a Google Sheet  
- The app uses Google APIs (or a public Google Sheets endpoint) to **read/write messages**  
- Flutter renders the messages as a scrollable chat interface  
- Works across mobile, web, and desktop (Flutter-supported platforms)
